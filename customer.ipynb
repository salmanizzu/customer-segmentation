    "# Customer Segmentation and Recommendation System Project\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we aim to enhance marketing strategies and increase sales for an online retail business by analyzing transactional data from a UK-based retailer. The dataset, which spans from 2010 to 2011, contains detailed information about customer purchases, including transaction dates, product descriptions, quantities, and prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Customer Segmentation: To group customers into distinct segments based on their purchasing behavior using the K-means clustering algorithm. This segmentation will allow the business to tailor marketing strategies to different customer groups effectively.\n",
    "2. Recommendation System: To develop a recommendation system that suggests top-selling products to customers within each segment who have not yet purchased those items. This will help boost sales and enhance customer satisfaction by providing personalized product recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset includes key information that helps us understand customer behavior and product preferences. Some of the most relevant features are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* InvoiceNo: Unique identifier for each transaction.\n",
    "* StockCode: Unique identifier for each product.\n",
    "* Description: A brief description of the product.\n",
    "* Quantity: Number of products purchased in each transaction.\n",
    "* InvoiceDate: The date when the transaction occurred.\n",
    "* UnitPrice: Price per product unit.\n",
    "* CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer.\n",
    "* Country: The country where the customer is based.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure the dataset is suitable for analysis, we will clean and preprocess the data by:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Handling missing or null values, especially in crucial fields like `CustomerID`.\n",
    "* Removing duplicate entries or erroneous records (e.g., transactions with negative quantities).\n",
    "* Converting the `InvoiceDate` to a more usable format, such as extracting year, month, and day features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "To create customer-level insights, we will engineer the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Recency: The time since a customer's last purchase.\n",
    "* Frequency: The total number of purchases made by the customer.\n",
    "* Monetary Value: The total amount spent by the customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "These features will allow us to perform clustering and distinguish between different customer groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Customer Segmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the K-means clustering algorithm, we will group customers based on the engineered features. This step will help us understand customer behavior patterns, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* High-frequency buyers vs. occasional buyers.\n",
    "* High spenders vs. low spenders.\n",
    "* Recency of the last purchase.\n",
    "* By identifying these distinct segments, the business can adjust its marketing strategies, such as offering promotions or discounts to * retain valuable customers or re-engaging dormant customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommendation System\n",
    "\n",
    "After segmentation, we will build a recommendation system that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Identifies the top-selling products in each segment.\n",
    "* Recommends these products to customers who haven’t yet purchased them.\n",
    "* This system will enhance the shopping experience by helping customers discover relevant products while also increasing sales for the business."

    "- **Reviewing basic statistics** such as mean, median, and distribution for numerical features.\n",
    "- **Identifying categorical features** and understanding their potential use in segmentation and recommendations.\n",
    "- **Inspecting anomalies** like negative values for quantity or price and handling them as needed.\n",
    "- **Visualizing key distributions** to better understand the data patterns and relationships.\n",
